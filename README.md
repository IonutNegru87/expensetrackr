Implement a simple Android Kotlin application that solves the following two user stories:

As a freelance I want to be able to:
- Take photos of my expenses (receipts or invoices).
- Add information about the receipt (date, total, currency, etc) and store it locally
- Access the history of the photos taken (should be available offline) with the data I inputted
- The app should work even if you are offline and should maintain its state after closing
- The solution must be thread safe and should be robust enough to handle large sets
of data.

Nice to have:
• Buildable and runnable
• Structured
• Maintainable
• Testable
